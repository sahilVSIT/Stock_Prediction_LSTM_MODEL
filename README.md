## Introduction

Stock price prediction is a common problem in financial analysis and machine learning. This project demonstrates how to use LSTM-based neural networks to predict stock prices. LSTM networks are suitable for modeling time series data due to their ability to capture temporal dependencies.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/sahilVSIT/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction

Arduino
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Markdown
3. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

.vbnet

## Usage

1. Download historical stock price data in CSV format and place it in the project directory.

2. Update the `data_file` variable in the code to specify the path to your CSV file.

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.

4. Evaluate the model's performance and visualize the results.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project should include at least two columns: "Date" and "Close" (closing prices). Ensure that the "Date" column is in datetime format and set as the index of the DataFrame.

## Preprocessing

The preprocessing step involves scaling the data using Min-Max scaling to a range between 0 and 1. This is done to ensure that the model can effectively learn from the data.

## Model Architecture

The LSTM model consists of two LSTM layers followed by a dense output layer. Dropout layers are added to prevent overfitting. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss.

## Training

The model is trained on a portion of the data (80% by default) and validated on the remaining data. Training parameters, such as the number of epochs and batch size, can be adjusted to optimize performance.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and other metrics. MAE measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual stock prices.

## Results

The project includes visualizations of the actual vs. predicted stock prices and error metrics over time steps. The overall MAE is also calculated to assess the model's accuracy.
